## Setting up the stage for R and RStudio.

>Welcome to the course! 

This is an interactive tutorial that should help you verify that you and your computer are ready to use R and RStudio.^[This document uses materials developed by *Garrick Aden-Buie, Barret Schloerke, JJ Allaire & Alexander Rossell Hayes* , the creators of the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/" target="_blank">learnR</a> package.]  


### Learning Objectives
At the end of this tutorial you should be able to:   

* Install R on your computer
* Install the RStudio IDE (*Integrated Development Environment*) 
* Install packages

You can skip this tutorial if you've already done these things and are familiar with R and RStudio environments, but it may be safer to check!

## Install R

### What is R? 
R is a statistical programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is an alternative to the traditional statistical packages such as SPSS, STATA and SAS. It has several benefits including: 

- it is open source – license free
- it can be used on 3 all operating systems: MacOS, Linux, UNIX and Windows; and 
- it is supported by an extensive community.

### Test your knowledge

```{r quiz2, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - About R",
  question("Is R free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "R is free _and_ open source, which means that anyone can read, use, and copy the source code of the R language."),
    answer("No.",  message = "R is indeed free _AND_ open source, which means that anyone can read, use, and copy the source code of the R language.")
  ),
  question("Where do you download R?",
    answer("www.rstudio.com/download"),
    answer("[cloud.r-project.org](http://cloud.r-project.org)", correct = TRUE, message = "You can also download R from [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org)"),
    answer("www.r-project.org", message = "Good try, but not exactly. www.r-project.org doesn't provide a download link, but it does provide a link to one the websites above."),
    answer("www.r.com"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How often should you update R?",
    answer("Everytime you use it", message = "This will be too often unless you use R very rarely!"),
    answer("About once a year", correct = TRUE, "A new version of R is released about once a year. Update sooner if you encounter a bug that you cannot explain."),
    answer("Never", message = "A new version of R is released about once a year. I'll assume that you are using the newest version of R, which will be the fastest version with the fewest unexpected behaviors." ),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Install RStudio

### What is RStudio?
RStudio is an R-specific Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This means it is a piece of software that was built for R (even though it can support other programming languages software) that combines several tools in one environment to make working with R more productive. 

The RStudio IDE comprises several windows including a console, an editor for writing, editing and executing source code along with tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace.

RStudio is the most common, beginner-friendly software for R users and the main tool that will be used for the practical exercises in this e-learning course.

> If your computer was a plane, we may think of RStudio as the cockpit  

### How to install RStudio

 RStudio makes editing, programming and visualizing in R much easier and we highly recommend that you install it and use it.  
 
 For that, follow the instructions in this video (*50 sec*)

### Test your knowledge

```{r quiz3, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Install RStudio",
  question("What is the RStudio IDE?",
    answer("An application that makes it easier to use R.", correct = TRUE, message = "RStudio organizes your workspace and makes it easier to write, use, debug, and save R code. We highly recommend it and we will rely on the RStudio IDE in this course."),
    answer("An application that let's you use R without writing any code", message = "And thank goodness! Code provides a reproducible record of your work, which is essential for data science."),
    answer("A spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel.", message = "No. Although we can visualise data in RStudio almost as in Microsoft Excel, RStudio is much more than that!"),
    answer("Another name for R", message = "No. R and RStudio are two separate things: R is the real data and code processing *engine* while RStudio is the environment that facilitate your life to provide instrcutions, like a *cokpit*. "),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Is the RStudio IDE free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features."),
    answer("No.", message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features.")
  ),
  question("Where do you download RStudio?",
    answer("https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/", correct = TRUE, message = "For these tutorials, download and install the RStudio Desktop Open Source License."),
    answer("[cloud.r-project.org](http://cloud.r-project.org)", message = "This is where you download R, not RStudio."),
    answer("www.r-project.org"),
    answer("[cran.rstudio.org](http://cran.rstudio.org)"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Do you need to install R if you already have RStudio?",
    answer("Yes.", correct = TRUE, message = " Yes. RStudio needs the R *engine* to work"),
    answer("No.", message = "R does not come with RStudio; you need to install R separately. It is best to start by installing R and then RStudio.")
  )
)
```

## Install Packages
R has several functions that are loaded and available in the basic installation of the programme. However, there are a range of other convenient functions and codes written by R users that can be used freely during your R session. These functions are distributed as R packages, which are basically a collection of R code, data sets, documentation, and tests that can be easily shared with others.

> If your computer was a plane, we may think of the packages as all the components needed to fly (landing gear, gyroscope, lights, GPS, ... )   

### How to install R packages
The best way is to follow the instructions in this video (*1 min 02s*)

![](https://youtu.be/u1r5XTqrCTQ?si=JxTF-VWz14EqY44t)


### The “tidyverse” package
To use an R package that did not come with the installation of RStudio, you must first install it, using the command `install.packages()`. 

For example, to install the package *tidyverse*, type and execute the following line of code in the script editor window. The argument for the R function is the name of the package, which must be enclosed by double quotation marks.  The tidyverse package is essential for data manipulation, exploration and visualization

```{r, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


This command will install the package *tidyverse* and store it in a directory in the R environment referred to as the “library”. 
The *tidyverse* package contains 8 packages namely *ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats* that are loaded automatically once with the `install.packages(“tidyverse”)` command. These packages allow the use of powerful functions that will be used throughout this course. 

### The “haven” Package 

One very commonly used R package is called “*haven*”. This package is necessary to read and write data files from other statistical software such as SPSS, Stata, SAS and Minitab into R. 

> To search for the “haven” package, go to the “*Files/ Plots/ Packages and Help*” pane !

- select the tab Packages.
- type “*haven*” in the search bar. 

You should see a result like the image below.

![](www/packages.png){width=80%}

The unchecked box means that the package is available in the library but has not been loaded for the library for use in the current R session. Checking the box is equivalent to loading the package  using the command `library(haven)`.


### How to access packages after they have been installed?

To use R packages during your R session, you must load it from the library using the `library()` function. For example, to load the haven package, we do the following:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
library("haven")
```

To access the manual for packages that have been loaded in the library, use the *help* argument with the function `library( )`


```{r, eval= FALSE}
library(help="haven")
```


Alternatively, you can simply use `help( )` function and specify the name of the package:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
help("haven")
```


> Note: You need to install R packages only once. However, you must load the relevant packages needed to perform the desired functions in R (using the `library( )` function), each time you start any R session.


### Test your knowledge

```{r names, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Working with Packages",
  question("What command do you use to install packages?",
    answer("`library()`", message = "We will see what `library()` does later."),
    answer("`install.packages()`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`install_packages()`"),
    answer("There is no command. You must visit [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org) and download packages manually.", message = "R makes it easy to download packages. You connect to the internet and then run one of the commands above."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How often do you need to install a package on your computer?",
    answer("Every time you restart R"),
    answer("Every time you restart your computer"),
    answer("Only once. Afterwards, R can find it on your hard drive as needed.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Never, as long as you are connected to the internet.", message = "This could be true if you are using R over a cloud service. However, if you are using R locally on your own computer, you will need to install each package that you use on your computer."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

> You are good to go now, R and RStudio are installed and you can start exploring all the packages that many users have created to help and facilitate our work!
