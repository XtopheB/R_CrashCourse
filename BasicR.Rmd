## Develop essential skills for data handling

This short interactive tutorial will introduce you to the essential elements of data handling in R, with a focus on using `tidyverse` for simple and efficient coding.  

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this tutorial you should be able to:   

* Run a few lines of R code
* Import data into R
* Start data exploration with `tidyverse` 

You can skip this tutorial if you are familiar with R and `tidyverse` but it may be safer to refresh your practice and maybe discover some new tricks and packages. 

### Is this tutorial for you?

Do you need to work through the tutorial? Take the quiz below to find out

```{r quiz0, echo = FALSE}
question("Check all that is TRUE:",
  answer("R is  installed on my computer",  correct = TRUE, message = "Good."),

## A short tutorial on R

### R Assignment Operator:
R uses ` <- ` as the assignment operator. This is a combination of the less than symbol (<) and hyphen (-). Essentially, the assignment operator tells R to assign values or data to a named object or variable.

```{r, eval =TRUE}
a <- 3 + 4
a
```

In the block of code above, we performed a simple mathematical operation **3 + 4** and stored the result (here the sum) in a variable called ***a***. Variables are used to store values for later use. The code above allows R to evaluate the expression 3 + 4 (on the right of the assignment operator) and then assign the sum; here 7, to the variable a (on the left of the assignment operator), for later use.

> The assignment done in the first line is "silent" - nothing will be displayed. One must request the value of the variable to be displayed, hence the second line.  

### Adding comments to your code:

It is a good practice to annotate your code in the R script editor. This includes adding short explanations on what the code or commands that you have written do as well as the meaning of variables or any objects that are created during an R Session. These explanations are written as comments.

In R, comments are preceded by the symbol `# ` (pound or hash). This helps R distinguish between comments and actual lines or blocks of code that the R programme must execute.


```{r, eval =TRUE}
# Create variable, named a, that stores the sum of 3 and 4
a <- 3 + 4
a
```


###  Basic R syntax

Let us define some elements to play with: 

```{r}
# Here I define a numerical variable 
myage <- 25

# And I can show it
myage
```

The first line does the assignment to the variable ** myage** (silently).  Now if I want to see the value, and  make it pretty, I can use the `paste()` function.  This function is quite useful for presenting results, titles, etc.,  as it *paste* text ( within quotes "  ") and other R objects (here a number). 

```{r, prepare}
paste("My age is", myage)

```


> R is **case sensitive**, which means that we have to be careful about how we name our objects and recall them 

***What will the following code return?** 
  
```{r, eval= FALSE}
MyAge <- 45
paste("My age is", myage)
```


```{r Case, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("My age is 45",
                message = "- Well, that would true be if ***MyAge*** and ***myage***  are similar. But since R is case sensitive, these two objects are different"),
         answer("My age is 25", message = "- Well-done! The `paste( )' function displays a message that combines the statement 'My age is' with the value stored in the object 'myage'. The objects *myage* and *Myage* are different objects as R is case-sensitive.", correct = TRUE),
         answer("25",
                message = " - We used `paste()` to have a sentence that assembles the text \"My age is\" and the value"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Try it by yourself and click on the `Run Code`  blue button. You can modify the code to change value, rename the objects *myage*, *MyAge etc.  The `Start Over` button resets the code to initial, so don't be shy to try! 

```{r tryit, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE }
myage <- 25
MyAge <- 45

paste("My age is", myage)
```


### Objects

In R everything is an **object**. This means that an element may embed some other *"things"* (other objects)

> Let's create objects!

#### Vectors

Vectors can be created (and conceived) as a concatenation of numbers. We use The `c()`  function to concatenate objects.

```{r}
# Let's create a vector
a <- c(1, 2, 3)

# Print content
a
```

> Try by yourself!

In the code below:

- Change the value of ***a*** and ***b***
- Concatenate ***a*** and ***b*** in the new vector ***myvect*** (fill the blank with code)
- Display it! 


```{r tryvect, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE }
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
# And another one 
b <- c(4, 5, 6)
# Concatenate and assign values to "myvect"
myvect <- 
```


```{r tryvect-hint-1}
# You can use again the c() function (fill the blanks)
myvect <- c( , )

```

```{r tryvect-solution}
# Solution: You can use again the c() function 
# Concatenate a and b and assign values to "myvect"
myvect <- c(a,b)

myvect
```

We have a double concatenation here since ***a*** = `c(1,2,3)` is already a concatenated object (a vector here)

> But we can also concatenate things that are of **different nature**! 

***What will the following code return?** 
```{r , eval= FALSE}
myobject <- c("A" , 1 )
myobject

```


```{r Concat, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("A1",
                message = "Well, not quite"),
         answer(" \"A \" \"1\" ", message = " Well-done", correct = TRUE),
         answer("An error",
                message = "No, We can really concatenate different things "),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Data Frames

A data frame is the equivalent of a tabular, *i.e.* a 2-dimensional, rectangular, data structure, which stores data in rows and columns. We will use these structures a lot, and as any object in R, we can access to its different component with different methods

> Let's create data frames and play with them!

```{r}
# Creating a data frame
mydata <- data.frame(name = c("John", "Sokol", "Chris"),
                     age = c(25, 30, 28),
                     student = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))
```

We have lots of tools to play with data frames


```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Here we have the first lines of this very small data frame
head(mydata)
```


The **structure** of the data frame is given by `str()` function. It is very important to identify which variable is numerical (*num*) or an integer (*int*), a factor (*factor*) or even a string (*chr*, for character) or a Boolean (*logi* with values TRUE/FALSE) as some operations will only apply for some *type* of variables.

> Look at the output below and identify the *type* of each variable

```{r}
str(mydata)
```

In this example,  we have 3 objects embedded in the data frame `mydata` which are:

- `name` (*character*), 
- `age` (*numeric*) and  
- `student` (*logical*). 

Each element can be accessed directly by adding the  `$` sign to the data frame. For example, the content of the variable `name` can be accessed using:   

```{r}
mydata$name
```


But, we can also extract each cell of  the data frame `mydata` using its rows and columns numbers.  

***What will the following code return?*** 
  
```{r, eval= FALSE}
mydata[1,]
```


```{r extract, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("The first row of mydata (*i.e.*, *John  25  TRUE*) ", message = " - Well-done", correct = TRUE),
         answer("The first column of mydata with all names (*John Sokol Chris*) ",
                message = " - That was close!"),
          answer("The first element of mydata (*John*)",
                message = "- Try again"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


***Hints and answers***

In R, square brackets have a special function for accessing or extracting values from objects, which is essential for data manipulation. The value(s) in the square brackets are called the **index**, which indicate the position of the elements to be extracted. The syntax uses the index to access the entire first row of the dataframe `mydata`. The output is the elements in row 1

> For data frames, the convention is **row** first, then **column**, that is:  `mydata[indexrow,indexcolumn]`

***Check it out by yourself***

```{r mydata, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# run this code to find out! 
mydata[1,]

```

```{r mydata-hint-1}
# You can visualize the whole data set again to be sure 
mydata

```

#### A new data.frame 

Consider the  `data.frame`  ***mynewdata*** 

```{r}
mynewdata <-  data.frame(
  name = c("Aldovia", "Borovia", "Corundia", "Dagbon", "Elbonia"),
  area = c(10000, 20000, 15000, 18000, 22000),
  flag_color = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Purple"),
  english = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
```

Play with `mynewdata` (recommended)  and **then** extract the **third** element of the **first** row

```{r prepare-a, exercise.eval = TRUE}
mynewdata <-  data.frame(
  name = c("Aldovia", "Borovia", "Corundia", "Dagbon", "Elbonia"),
  area = c(10000, 20000, 15000, 18000, 22000),
  flag_color = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Purple"),
  english = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
```


```{r extract2,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "prepare-a"}
# Enter your solution below


```

```{r extract2-hint-1}
# maybe you could use the head function first
head(mynewdata)

```


```{r extract2-hint-2}
# Now that you have seen the data, you have to extract elements and fill the blanks here:
mynewdata[ , ]

```

```{r extract2-solution}
# Solution : 1 for the row and 3 for column in that order
mynewdata[1,3]
```


The output of `mynewdata[1,3]' is “red”. The command allows us to access the single element in a data frame in position **row 1** and **column position 3**.

>We'll see later on that there are many other ways to play with *data frames*, in particular using the `tidyverse`syntax

***Easy Summary***

We can also have quick statistics using the  `summary()` function. As you can see in the output below, the `summary()`  function adapts the result to the **type** of variable, whether it is a character (no summary for  *name* or *flag_color*), a numeric variable (*area*), or a Boolean or logical variable (*english* takes `TRUE` or `FALSE` values).  

> This is an important feature of R functions and highlights the importance having the correct ***type*** for the variables in a data frame.  


```{r, eval=TRUE}
# A summary
summary(mynewdata)
```

> Typically, data sets (imported or created) will be stored in data frames


##  Importing data into R

Before we can begin any analysis, we need to first read or import that data set into R.  
R allows the import of data of various types, from data stored in commonly used formats such as comma-separated values (CSV) or MS Excel (xls/xlsx) to those stored in commercial statistical packages such as SPSS, Stata or SAS. 

### Importing MS Excel files 

It is really easy to import files in R. As usual, we will just need to use the right package for that. We use here the package "**readxl**", even if some other exists.  As any package, you'll need to install it before loading using the `install.packages()` function as below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(readxl)
```

> Remember that you only need to install a package once, but have to load it in every R session that uses it. 

The function `read_excel( )` accepts several arguments, such as the sheet to read in the excel file, or whether or not to use the column names, but the most important argument is the **path** to the xls/xlsx file, as below:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
# loading the readxl package
library(readxl)
# loading the data
Mydataset <- read_excel(path ="Myexcel.xls")

```

The lines of code above first load the package *readxl* using the `library()` function.  The second line, creates a data frame called *Mydataset* that stores the data from the excel data file called “*Myexcel.xls*”.  Remember that a data frame is a data structure in R that stores spread-sheet like data, as rows (observations or cases) and columns (variables). 

> The `path` indicates where the file is located on your hard drive. By default, R will search in the same folder of your file but this can vary, and can be adjusted.


### Importing Stata files 

We will explore now how to import a data set in Stata file format, which carries the file extension *.dta*. 

To read a Stata data file into R, we use the command `read_dta( )` function.  To use this function, we need to load the “**haven**” package presented earlier.  This package has the relevant tools and functions to import data from commercial software.  

The function `read_dta( )` accepts only one argument, which is the full name or file path, including the file extension as shown below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# loading the  haven package
library(haven)
# loading the data from Stata file format
Mytest <- read_dta("testdata.dta")

```

The lines of code above first load the package *haven* using the `library()` function.  The second line, creates a data frame called *Mytest* that stores the data from the data file called “*testdata.dta*”. 


### Importing SPSS data into R

We will now see how to import a data set in SPSS file format that carries the file extension *.sav*.  To import or read files of that format into R, we need the R package called **foreign**. Like the **haven** package, the **foreign** package contains a range of functions that will allow you to import data files from some of the other statistical software packages aside from SPSS such as Stata and SAS into R. If you have not yet installed the foreign package, use the command `install.packages(“foreign” )`.  

We are now ready to read SPSS data into R.  To do this, we use the `read.spss( )` function. This function accepts several arguments. The first argument, *file is the name of the data file. The second argument  *to.data.frame* tells R to convert the data set into a data frame. We should assign a name to the data frame that will be created when the data set has been imported into R. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# loading the foreign package
library(foreign)
# loading the data drom SPSS file
MyTest2 <- read.spss(file ="testdata.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE) 

```

The lines of code above first load the package *foreign* using the `library()` function. 
The second line creates a new data frame called *MyTest2* that stores the data from the SPSS data file called "*testdata.sav*".  


***Test yourself! ***


```{r Qoperator, echo = FALSE}
question("Which operator is used to access a column by name in a data frame? ",
          answer("The operator `$` ", message = " - Well-done: In a data frame, one can access to a specific column by its name after a `$`, as in `mydata$age`. This is equivalent to `mydata[,2]` if *age* is in the column index 2.", correct = TRUE),
         answer("The operator `@` ", message = "- Try again"),
         answer("The operator `&` ", message = "- Try again"),
         answer("The operator `#` ", message = "- Try again"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


```{r Qaccess, echo = FALSE}
question("How do you access the element in the **second row** and **first column** of a data frame *df*? ",
          answer("Using `df[1, 2]` ", message = " - Well-done!", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Using `df[2, 1]`  ", message = "- Read the instruction again, you're close!"),
         answer("Using `df$1[2]` ", message = "- Try again"),
         answer("Using `df[1,]`", message = "- Try again"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


```{r Qimport, echo = FALSE}
question("Which of the packages are used to import SPSS files into R? ",
         answer("The package *haven* ", message = " - Well-done", correct = TRUE),
         answer("The package *readr* ", message = "- Try again"),
         answer("The package *xlsxr* ", message = "- Try again"),
         answer("The package *tidyverse* ", message = "- *tidyverse* is a great libray, but not for importing data"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


```{r Qstata, echo = FALSE}
question("What is the correct function to import Stata files into R? ",
          answer("The function `read_dta()` ", message = " - Well-done!", correct = TRUE),
         answer("The function `read.dta()` ", message = "- This is a very common mistake. Try again."),
         answer("The function `read.stata()` ", message = "- Try again"),
         answer("The function `haven()` ", message = "- *haven* is a library, not a fonction! Try again"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


### Importing any file with RStudio

It is also possible to use the RStudio *environment* interface to load any data set. 
![](https://uedufy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-768x377.png)

Then select the format of your file using the drop down menu. 

![](https://uedufy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-28-at-11.36.48-768x219.png)


You can also configure options such as the sheet to open in excel, as shown [in this tutorial](https://uedufy.com/how-to-import-an-excel-file-into-r-6-easy-steps/) (from Leonard at Uedufy.com). 
 
 > **NB**: The code resulting form this operation will be copied in your document after the importation for reproducibility. 
 

## Data exploration

### Data sets operations 
We will use a pre-loaded data set with some SDGs. The name of the data frame is simply `SDG` 

####  The dataset
Before playing with some functions, let's have a look at the variables available in the `SDG` data set using some base R commands. 

First, let us see what are the variables using the `names()` function. 

```{r data, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
names(SDG)
```

Now, can you display the first 5 lines of the data set (maybe using using the `head()` function) ?


```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

**Note:** by default, `head()` shows the **6** first rows! 
*Try maybe with an option (type a comma, inside the function, after the name of the data frame to see some options)*


```{r filter2-solution}
head(SDG, n=5)
```

> That was easy, right? But this will be even easier with the `tidyverse`syntax.


## Playing with `tidyverse` 

The tidyverse makes working with data in R easier and more natural, like telling a story with your data.

There are many functions available in the package `tidyverse`, in particular, one has many tools for filtering and visualizing the data. 
 
First, let's examine the `pipe`  operator (or `%>%`) that pass the result of one expression into the next.

> With `%>%`,  we tell a story with code and move data set from one transformation to another.^[In R, both `%>%`  (from tidyverse) and `|>`  (base R) can be used to pass the result of one expression into the next. We will work with the tidyverse where `%>%` has more features, but the logic is the same.]  
 
 
Imagine the following data story:  "*Take only the first 3 variables in the data set `SDG` , then count the number of countries that are in the "Asia" region and with a population greater than 50 millions*". This is how the code would translate that story: 

```{r}
# Firstly, I create a new data frame with only the first 3 variables (note the use of " : " )
df <- SDG[, 1:3]

# Then,  I want to subset that data to keep only the "Asia" region (note the use of " subset() " )
df <- subset(df, region_name == "Asia" & population >= 50) 

# Finally, I Count the number of rows (note the use of " nrow()" )
nrow(df)
```

This requires quite a few lines of code, the creation of temporaty files (*df*) and a sequence of actions...

>  But there is a more readable solution


The`%>% `  helps linking operations in a very easy-to-read sequence. The code below does exactly the same operation as before, but passing the result of one expression into the next using  `%>% `.

> One may read  `%>% ` as:  *next do this (please)* !


```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
SDG %>%  
  filter(region_name == "Asia" &  population >= 50) %>%
  nrow()
```

The function `filter()`  lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. `filter()` will return every row that passes **each** logical test.^[ `filter()` is an alternative to `subset()`] `nrow()` finally counts the number of rows in the resulting data frame. 

So the story above reads as: 

- Take the data set `SDG`,
- **then**  `filter` only observations where *region_name* is exactly "ASIA"  **and** for which *population* is above 50,  
- **then** give me the number of rows.  

> Easy, no? 

### Test Your Knowledge
We can use many different logical tests to filter data, such as:

- `==`  (identical),
- `>` (strictly greater),
- `>=` (greater or equal)   
-  `&` (and) , `|` (or) , `!` (not) 


***What will the following code return?*** 
  
```{r, eval= FALSE}
SDG %>%  
  filter( (region_name == 'Asia' | region_name == "Africa") &
         internet_use > 60 ) 
  
```


```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("Every country in either Asia or Africa,  with internet use greater than 60% ",
                message = " - The filter applies to *region_name* with  \" | \"  wich means  \" or \" , Excellent!",
                correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every country with a name starting with \"A\",  with internet use greater than 60% ",
                message = " - The filter  applies to *region_name*  not to country. Try again!  "),
          answer("Every country in either Asia or Africa",
                message = "- The filter also conditions on *internet_use*, try again!  "),
         answer("Every country  with internet use greater than 60%  ",
                message = " - The filter applies also to *region_name*,  try again!  "),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.",
                message = "- This code is perfectly fine and use **two** conditions"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

> From now on, we will write code using the `tidyverse` syntax and the pipe  `%>%` operator as often as possible. 

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English.

$\hookrightarrow$ You **cannot** write `filter(SDG, region_name == "Asia" | "Africa" )`, R will expect a condition after the `|` and will return an error, even though you want `region_name` that are *either* Asia ***or**  Africa. You have to repeat the condition in full, and write: 

`filter(SDG, region_name == "Asia" | region_name == "Africa" )`

> This is one of the common mistake we all do! 

A useful solution for this problem is to use the ` %in%` operator.  In the condition:  `x %in% y`, we will select every row where *x* is one of the values **in** *y* (for example a vector with a set of values). We could use it to rewrite the code above as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SDG %>%  
 filter(region_name %in% c("Asia", "Africa") & internet_use > 60 ) 
    
```

### Advanced functions

You can also use advanced functions like `str_starts()` (*string starts with*) to select countries in a region starting with "A" —though in our case, this would include "*Americas*" as well!

```{r}
SDG %>%  
  filter(str_starts(region_name, 'A') & internet_use > 50 ) 
```

### Exercise 

Use the code chunks below to count the number of countries that:

#### Have a *maternal mortality rate* lower than 12%

```{r filterex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
SDG %>%
```
    
```{r filterex1-solution}
SDG %>% 
  filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <= 12)
```

Find the variable *maternal_mortality_ratio* variable (use the small right arrow) and explore the table with the results

> Is there a problem with the *maternal_mortality_ratio* values? 

#### Find out wich are the countries with a negative values for *maternal mortality rate* 

```{r filterex2, exercise = TRUE}

```
    

```{r filterex2-solution}
# To ease the reading, we use select() to restrict to variables of interest 
SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio < 0 ) %>%
  select(country, maternal_mortality_ratio)
```

#### Find the number of countries in Asia with a  *maternal mortality rate* lower than 30%? 

```{r filterex3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
SDG %>% 
  
```


```{r filterex3-hint}
# we can use filter() to select the countries fulfilling the conditions

SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <30 & region_name =="Asia" )

```


```{r filterex3-solution}
# we use select() to restrict to variables of interest (easier to read)

SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <30 & region_name =="Asia" ) %>%
  select(country, population, maternal_mortality_ratio) 


```


> Is there a second problem with the data set ? 

 Let's look again and use the function `select`to select only few variables of interest (easier to read) 

```{r filterex4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
# we use select() to restrict to variables of interest (easier to read)
SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <30 , region_name =="Asia" ) %>%
  select(country, population, maternal_mortality_ratio) 

```

**Yes**,  there is a  duplicate problem! 
Can you solve it and **count**  the number of countries with distinct values? (*see the `hints` to find out*).

```{r filterex4-hint}
# we can use distinct() to select only lines with distinct values 

SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <30 & region_name =="Asia" ) %>%
  select(country, population, maternal_mortality_ratio) %>%
  distinct()
```

```{r filterex4-solution }
# Solution:  we can use distinct() to select only lines with distinct values 

SDG %>% 
filter(maternal_mortality_ratio <30 & region_name =="Asia" ) %>%
  select(country, population, maternal_mortality_ratio) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  nrow()
  
```


### The `mutate()` function  

The `mutate()` function is used to create new variables or transform existing ones by adding columns to a data frame. It’s especially useful to do calculations using existing variables.

Let's work again with our data frame *SDG*. 

```{r}
# Creating a new variable with the GDP per capita
SDG <- SDG %>% 
  mutate(gdp_per_capita = gross_domestic_product / population)
    
```

We applied `mutate()` to the data frame *SDG* (through the pipe  `%>%`) to create a new variable *gdp_per_capita* that is simply the row-by-row division of *gross_domestic_product* by *population*. We now have this new variable in our data frame. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Display the names of all variables 
names(SDG)
```

> Your turn!

In the data frame *SDG*,  using `mutate(), create a new variable  named *pop_milions* that converts the population to millions (simply divide *population* by 10^6).


```{r mutatex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Create a new variable with population in millions
SDG <-
```
    
```{r mutatex1-hint-1}
# You must start by saying that the result will be affected to the data frame SDG
SDG <- SDG %>%
  
  
```

    
```{r mutatex1-hint-2}
# Defining the new variable uses mutate(). Fill the blank
SDG <- SDG %>%
   mutate(pop_millions =      )
 
```

    
```{r mutatex1-solution}
# Solution: One million can be written as 1000000 or 10^6 or simply 1e6 
SDG <- SDG %>%
   mutate(pop_millions = population / 10^6) 
 
```

#### Multiple transformations at once

It is possible to create many variables at once with `mutate()` as in this example: 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
SDG_rich <- SDG %>%
  mutate(
    gdp_per_capita = gross_domestic_product / population,
    pop_millions = population / 10^6  )
```

note that you can reuse a variable name you're overwriting - because mutate() evaluates expressions sequentially. So in this code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SDG <- SDG %>%
  mutate(population = population / 10^6)
```
  
`mutate()` takes the original value of *population* from the input data frame and **transforms**^[Technically, `mutate()` takes the original value of *population* from the input data frame and creates a ***new*** *population* column with the updated value (divided by 1 million). The left-hand side (population = ...) defines the ***new*** column - and it can have the same name -while the right-hand side still has access to the original column values.]  the original *population* column with the updated value (divided by 1 million).

#### This is however dangerous
While R allows it, it's often considered **risky** or **confusing**  because:

- You lose the original data by overwriting *population* and changing units
- It reduces clarity for someone reading your code  and not realize you've changed the units.
- It can cause bugs and multiple divisions of the same variable (by $10^6$) if you're runing  multiple calls of your code reusing the same name across them

> We recommend to use new names and to never alter the original variables 
 
***What will the following code return?*** 
  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SDG_rich <- SDG %>%
  mutate(
    gdp_per_capita = gross_domestic_product / population,
    pop_millions = population / 10^6  ) %>%
  filter(gdp_per_capita > 20 )

```


```{r mutateQ, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("A new data frame ",
                message = " - The data frame *SDG_rich* is created from *SDG* through `SDG_rich <- SDG` ",
                correct = TRUE),
         answer("A copy of *SDG* data frame, with two new variables and only countries with *GDP_per_capita* >20  ",
                message = " - The fifth line uses the newly created variable *GDP_per_capita* for filtering, 
                thanks to piping ( `%>%`).", correct = TRUE),
          answer("The *SDG* data frame, with two new variables and only countries with GDP per capita >20 ",
                message = " - The output is a new data frame *SDG_rich* - not *SDG*  created from *SDG* through `SDG_rich <- SDG`  "),
         answer("Every country  from *SDG* data frame with with GDP per capita >20    ",
                message = " - The output is a new data frame"),
         answer("An error since the variable  *GDP_per_capita* does not exist yet in the data frame.",
                message = " - This code is perfectly fine- and quite efficient!"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         post_message = "It is indeed possible to create many variables at once with `mutate()`, and to use them immediately, by combining functions - such as  `filter()`  - with  the pipe `%>%`!",
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### The `summarize()` function  

The `summarise()` function is used to collapse multiple rows into a summary statistic, such as a total, average, min, max, etc. It's often used to calculate summaries by group.^[Using the operator `group_by()` that is presented below.]

> Using `summarise()` one can create a summary of any **numeric** variable


```{r , eval = TRUE}
SDG %>%
  summarise(mean_gdp = mean(gross_domestic_product))
```

Formally, the output is a single-row data frame with a summary - here the mean- of the variable *gross_domestic_product*. Just like `mutate()`, it creates a new variable but that variable is at the same time aggregated accross rows to create a single value. 

> Your turn!

***What is the maximum maternal mortality ratio in the data set?***

(*Use `summarise()` to compute *max_mortality**.)


```{r sumex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
#  Start with the data set SDG
SDG %>%
```
    
```{r sumex1-hint-1}
# Compute the maximum with summarise(). Fill the blank
SDG %>%
  summarise(max_mortality = )
  
```

```{r sumex1-solution}
# Compute the maximum with max()
SDG %>%
  summarise(max_mortality = max(maternal_mortality_ratio) )
  
 
```

There are many functions that can be used with  `summarize()` :

- `mean()`	: Average  value
- `median()` :  Median 	value
- `sum()`	 :  Aggregates the total of the variable
- `min()` ,  `max()`	: Smallest ,  largest value
- `sd()` , `var()`		:  Standard deviation, Variance
- `n()`	:  Count of rows
- `n_distinct()`	: Number of unique values
- and many others..


### The `group_by()` function

The `group_by()` is a very powerful function is used to **group rows** of your data by one or more **categorical** variables (like *region*, here). It doesn’t change the data you see, but it changes how R thinks about the data.  It  organize the data into groups based on the values of one or more variables. Once grouped, any function you apply (like  `mutate()`, `summarise()`, `filter()`, etc.) will act **within each group**, instead of across the whole dataset.

> Think of `group_by()` like computing one category at the time (independently).

Look at the result of this code: 

```{r}
SDG %>%
  group_by(region_name) %>%
  summarise(Nb_countries = n())

```

#### A bit of explanation 
 The code here starts with the data frame *SDG*, then using `group_by()` we compute the next code **for each** *region_name*.

The result is the number of country (using `n()`) in each region. Note that the data frame *SDG* has not been modified at all.  

> Your turn! 

***What is the median value of the maternal mortality ratio for each region?*** 

(use the variable *maternal_mortality_ratio* )


```{r groupex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Compute the max population by area (using region_name)
SDG %>%
```
    
```{r groupex1-hint-1}
# We need to compute by region, then use the group_by() function
SDG %>%
  group_by()
  
  
```

```{r groupex1-hint-2}
# Now, any following computation is done independently in  each region 
SDG %>%
  group_by(region_name) %>%
  
  
```

```{r groupex1-hint-3}
# We can use the function summarise() to do the computation! 
SDG %>%
  group_by(region_name) %>%
  summarise() 
  
```

```{r groupex1-solution}
# Solution: Simply use summarize to compute this for each category in region_name
SDG %>%
  group_by(region_name) %>%
  summarise(median_mortality = median(maternal_mortality_ratio))
 
```

The function `group_by()` is extremely useful and powerful. It greatly simplifies coding, avoiding looping across categories of a variable like by region, year, or gender. By combining `group_by()` with functions like `summarise()` or `mutate()` one can break data into separate parts and analyze each part separately.


> Many other functions from the `tidyverse` can help you explore, refine, and transform a dataset to compute meaningful values and indicators. With practice, you'll discover these tools and naturally incorporate them into your coding routine.
