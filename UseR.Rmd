## Work with survey data and Compute SDG indicators 

Using the materials covered in the previous modules, we will start computing some simple SDGs using interactive coding and with a focus on using `tidyverse` for simple and efficient coding. 

### Learning Objectives **TBD**
At the end of this module you should be able to:   

* Run a few lines of R code
* Compute averages from Survey data
* Create descriptive statistics and graphics
* Compute with matrices


> *We highly recommend that you follow the order of the items proposed in this tutorial*!

### Have you successfully completed the R-Tutorial?

```{r quiz0, echo = FALSE}
question("Have you completed the basic R- Tutorial?  (*Check all that is TRUE*):",
  answer("Yes", correct = TRUE, message = "Perfect"),
  answer("No, I'm just starting here",  message = "Please start at the beginning with the Basic R course (https://xtophedataviz.shinyapps.io/BasicR/)" )
  )
  
```



## Average income from survey data

We have a data set from a survey that reports information on `r nrow(household_survey)` households, including their *location* (urban or rural), their *income* and other information. 

Let's have a look at the 5 first rows of this data set called *household_survey*:

```{r}
head(household_survey)
```

In total we have  `r ncol(household_survey)` variables to explore (*use the top right black arrow to navigate if they are not all appearing on your screen*).

> We want to compute  the average income for *rural*` population.  How would you do? 

The formula is the following: 
 
$$
Avg\_Income^{rural} = \frac{Total\_Income^{rural}}{Nb\_Households^{rural}}
$$

There are 4 basic steps: 

- Select only rural population 
- Count the number of rural households $\rightarrow$ **Denominator**
- Compute the total income of rural population $\rightarrow$ **Numerator**
- Compute the ratio 

We will compute this step-by step! 

### Step 1: Selecting only rural households

This can be done using the `filter` function in the *tidyverse* librar. This function allows to filter only observations (rows) that satisfy a condition.

>In our case, we only want "rural"  households (`location == rural`)

Give it a try and create a new data frame with only rural households

```{r PopDat, exercise.eval = TRUE}
household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural")

```

```{r PopDat1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
# Enter your solution below

household_rural <-
  

```

```{r PopDat1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_survey and the %>% operator
# Use a new line with the condition on location

household_rural <-  household_survey %>%
  
```

```{r PopDat1-hint-2}
# You can use function filter () 
# --> Write the condition in the filter() function

household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter()
  
```

```{r PopDat1-solution}
# Solution: Pay attention to the double == when conditioning

household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural")

```

**Congratulations** The data frame *household_rural* has now only rural households. 

Check the new data frame here and observe the first rows. They should now be all rural (run code).  

```{r Popex-Valid, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
head(household_rural)
```



### Step 2: Counting rural households (*denominator*)

Here, we will use the data frame with only rural households (named *household_rural*) and count them. A sueful fucntion may be the function `count()`.

```{r PopDen1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
# Enter your solution below

Nb_rural <-
  

```

```{r PopDen1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_rural and the %>% operator
# Use a new line to compute the total of Income

Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  

```

```{r PopDen1-hint-2}
# You can use the function count() -->  Write the code in a new line

Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  count()


```


```{r PopDen1-solution}
# Solution: We simply use the count() function to compute the number of rows!
Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  count()

Nb_rural
```

### Step 3: Compute the total income of rural population (*numerator*) 

This is the numerator $Total\_Income^{rural}$, computed as the **sum** of incomes **over all observations**. 

To compute this value, we will start with the data frame with only rural observations  (*household_rural*), and then **sum** the incomes.
We may create a new variable (using `mutate()`) and compute the desired sum using the function `sum()` :

> Your turn!

(*Use the hints*)


```{r PopNum, exercise.eval = TRUE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  mutate(total = sum(income))

```

```{r PopNum1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopNum"}
# Enter your solution below

income_rural <-
  
```

```{r PopNum1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_rural and the %>% operator
# Use a new line to compute the total of Income

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  

```

```{r PopNum1-hint-2}
# We will use mutate() to create a new variable(new column)
# --> Write what we want in the ()

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  mutate()

```

```{r PopNum1-solution}
# We use the function sum()  to compute the total
# Total has the sum of income across all rows

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  mutate(total = sum(income))


```

#### A bit of explanation: 

- `mutate()` creates a new variable (here *total*) in a data frame
- `sum(income)` sums the income across all rows
-  So our variable `total` has that value in every row

> Check the result here:

```{r }
# Visualizing only a few variables of the result (with select())
income_rural %>%
  select(Id, income, location, total)%>%
  head()
```

We have a data frame with a variable (*total*) that has our result, but repeated for all observations!  That's the way mutate works. It creates a variable with the value assigned - here the sum over all observations. 

> **A solution** to reduce the data frame to a single value is to summarize the variable *total* using the function `summarize ()` instead of `mutate()`.^[The function `summarize()` returns the *mean*  of a variable. Since the variable  *total*  has only one value repeated, this gives us that value with no effort.]


```{r}
# We use the function summarize()  to resume total to a single value
income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income))

income_rural
  
```

> Now we can compute the ratio in the final step ! 

### Step 4: Computing the average income for rural households (*numerator/denominator*)

the result should be as simple as a simple division: 

 
$$
Avg\_Income^{rural} = \frac{Total\_Income^{rural}}{Nb\_Households^{rural}} =   \frac{Numerator}{Denominator}
$$


```{r Avg1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
# Enter your solution below

avg_income <-
  
```

```{r Avg1-hint-1}
# The ratio is simply using the  / operator

avg_income <-  ? / ?
  

```

```{r Avg1-solution}
# Solution: Divide numerator by denominator

avg_income <- income_rural/Nb_rural

avg_income

```


> This required a lot of steps. Couldn't we  *pipe* ( `%>%` ) all of that? 

### Finally: A concise and efficient way of computing

In the following code, we combine all elements using the *pipe* operator `%>%` to chain operations:

> Examine the code below:


```{r final}
avg_income <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural") %>%
  summarize(avg = sum(income) / n() )

```

#### A bit of explanation: 

- `filter()` keep only households from rural areas.
- `sum()` computes the sum over all households (which are all rural now) 
-  `n()` is the number of observations in the current state of the data frame (so only rural here).^[`n()`is a special function that returns the number of rows in a data frame, typically used inside summarise, mutate, or filter when working with *grouped data*. `count()` groups the data, counts the obseravtions and returns a single value.]
-  The result is affected to the variable named here *avg*
- `summarize()` is used as a *trick*  to have only one value (*avg* would be the same for each row)^[The function `summarize()` returns the *mean*  of a variable. Since the variable created has only one value repeated, this gives us that value with no effort. There are other way to proceed, but this is one of the simplest one.]

> We will see later that there are  different methods to compute the same results. It is important though to follwo the flow of operation and understand the logic of each step. ^[This is another way of computing 
`avg_income2 <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural") %>%
  pull(income) %>%
  mean()` 
  where we use `pull() `to extract the income values as a vector (only on rural households) and compute the mean of that vector using `mean()`.]


### Quiz

```{r quiz2, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Which function is used to subset the dataset to only rural housholds?",
    answer("mutate()", correct = FALSE,  message = " No, mutate is used to create a new variable"),
    answer("summarize()", correct = FALSE, message = "No, summarize provides a summary of a variable"),
    answer("filter()", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes, the filter() function is equivalent to subset(). It follows a logical condition and keep only obervations for wich the outcome is TRUE")
  ),
  
  question("Which function helps to count the number of households?",
    answer("count()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("sum()", correct = FALSE, message = "No, the sum() fucntion just sums a vairable over all observations."),
    answer("group_by()", correct = FALSE, message = " No,even if we could have counted both location using group_by (but this is a bit advanced)")
  ),
  
  question_checkbox("Which functions were used in computing the average income?",
    answer("filter()", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes, the filter() function is equivalent to subset()"),
    answer("summarize()", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes, summarize provides a summary of a variable"),
    answer("mutate()", correct = FALSE, message = " No, mutate is used to create a new variable"),
    answer("group_by()", correct = FALSE, message = " No,even if we could have made the computation for both location using group_by (but this is a bit advanced)")
    ), 
    
   question_checkbox("IMPORTANT: Is there a problem in the way we compute that average?",
    answer("Yes, because we have survey and thus *weights*", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes, We must take the weights into consideration for the computation."),
    answer("No, this is the correct way to go", correct = FALSE, message = "Alas! We have to redo the computation, because we have a survey with weights for each household."),
    answer("I don't know !", correct = FALSE)
  )
)

```


###  We should compute a weighted average! 

> The previous computation did not take into account the fact that,  in a survey, observations are associated with a weight characterizing their representativeness in the target population.

Let's redo the computation with the exact formula: 

 
$$
Avg\_Income^{rural} = \frac{Total\_weighted\_Income^{rural}}{Nb\_weighted\_Households^{rural}} =  \frac{\sum_i Income^{rural}_i \times weight_i }{\sum_i weight_i^{rural}}
$$
We can follow the same scheme, but note that we already have the rural sub population in a specific data frame *household_rural*, no need to recompute this! 

###  Step 2: Compute the **weighted** income of rural population

```{r WPopNum, exercise.eval = TRUE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
income_weighted_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income * weight))

```



```{r WPopNum1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "WPopNum"}
# Enter your solution below

income_rural <-
  

```

```{r WPopNum1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_rural and the %>% operator
# Use a new line to compute the total of Income

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  

```

```{r WPopNum1-hint-2}
# You can use function summarize() 

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize()


```

```{r WPopNum1-solution}
# Solution: We use the function sum()  to compute the total

income_weighted_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income * weight))

income_weighted_rural

```

A bit of explanation: 

- `income * weight` multiplies row by row (without explicitly creating a new column).
- As previously `sum()` then sums the result across all rows
