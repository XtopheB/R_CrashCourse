## Work with survey data and Compute SDG indicators 

Using the materials covered in the previous modules, we will start computing some simple SDGs using interactive coding and with a focus on using `tidyverse` for simple and efficient coding. 

### Learning Objectives **TBD**
At the end of this module you should be able to:   

* Run a few lines of R code
* Compute averages from Survey data
* Create descriptive statistics and graphics
* Compute with matrices


> *We highly recommend that you follow the order of the items proposed in this tutorial*!

### Have you successfully completed the R-Tutorial?

```{r quiz0, echo = FALSE}
question("Have you completed the basic R- Tutorial?  (*Check all that is TRUE*):",
  answer("Yes", correct = TRUE, message = "Perfect"),
  answer("No, I'm just starting here",  message = "Please start at the beginning with the Basic R course (https://xtophedataviz.shinyapps.io/BasicR/)" )
  )
  
```



## Average income from survey data

We have a data set from a survey that reports information on `r nrow(household_survey)` households, including their *location* (urban or rural), their *income* and other information. 

Let's have a look at the 5 first rows of this data set called *household_survey*:

```{r}
head(household_survey)
```

In total we have  `r ncol(household_survey)` variables to explore (*use the top right black arrow to navigate if they are not all appearing on your screen*).

> We want to compute  the average income for *rural*` population.  How would you do that? 

The formula is the following: 
 
$$
Avg\_Income^{rural} = \frac{Total\_Income^{rural}}{Nb\_Households^{rural}}
$$

There are 4 basic steps: 

- Select only rural population 
- Count the number of rural households $\rightarrow$ **Denominator**
- Compute the total income of rural population $\rightarrow$ **Numerator**
- Compute the ratio 

We will compute this step-by step! 

### Step 1: Selecting only rural households

This can be done using the `filter` function in the *tidyverse* library. This function allows to filter only observations (rows) that satisfy a condition.

>Since we only want "rural"  households, one can filter using `location == "Rural"`. ^[Be careful of using the right spelling for "Rural" with a capital "R" letter. ]

Give it a try and create a new data frame with only rural households

```{r PopDat, exercise.eval = TRUE}
household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural")

```

```{r PopDat1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat", exercise.cap = "Create a data set with only rural households"}
# Enter your solution below

household_rural <-
  

```

```{r PopDat1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_survey and the %>% operator
# Use a new line with the condition on location

household_rural <-  household_survey %>%
  
```

```{r PopDat1-hint-2}
# You can use function filter () 
# --> Write the condition in the filter() function

household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter()
  
```

```{r PopDat1-solution}
# Solution: Pay attention to the double == when conditioning

household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural")

```

**Congratulations** The data frame *household_rural* has now only rural households. 

Check the new data frame here and observe the first rows. They should now be all rural (run code).  

```{r Popex-Valid, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
head(household_rural)
```

### Step 2: Counting rural households (*denominator*)

Here, we will use the data frame with only rural households (named *household_rural*) and count them. A useful function may be the function `count()`.

```{r PopDen1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat", exercise.cap = "Count the rural population"}
# Enter your solution below

Nb_rural <-
  

```

```{r PopDen1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_rural and the %>% operator
# Use a new line to compute the total of Income

Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  

```

```{r PopDen1-hint-2}
# You can use the function count() -->  Write the code in a new line

Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  count()


```


```{r PopDen1-solution}
# Solution: We simply use the count() function to compute the number of rows!
Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  count()

Nb_rural
```

### Step 3: Compute the total income of rural population (*numerator*) 

This is the numerator $Total\_Income^{rural}$, computed as the **sum** of household incomes **over all observations** (households in rural areas). 

To compute this value, we will start with the data frame with only rural observations  (*household_rural*), and then **sum** the incomes.
We may create a new variable (using `mutate()`) and compute the desired sum using the function `sum()` :

> Your turn!

(*Use the hints*)


```{r PopNum, exercise.eval = TRUE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  mutate(total = sum(income))

```

```{r PopNum1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopNum", exercise.cap = "Compute the income sum for rural households"}
# Enter your solution below

income_rural <-
  
```

```{r PopNum1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_rural and the %>% operator
# Use a new line to compute the total of Income

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  

```

```{r PopNum1-hint-2}
# We will use mutate() to create a new variable(new column)
# --> Write what we want in the ()

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  mutate()

```

```{r PopNum1-solution}
# We use the function sum()  to compute the total
# Total has the sum of income across all rows

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  mutate(total = sum(income))


```

#### A bit of explanation: 

- `mutate()` creates a new variable (here *total*) in a data frame
- `sum(income)` sums the income across all rows
-  So our variable `total` has that value in every row

> Check the result here:

```{r }
# Visualizing only a few variables of the result (with select())
income_rural %>%
  select(Id, income, location, total)%>%
  head()
```

We have a data frame with a variable (*total*) that has our result, but repeated for all observations!  That's the way mutate works. It creates a variable with the value assigned - here the sum over all observations. 

> **A solution** to reduce the data frame to a single value is to summarize the variable *total* using the function `summarize ()` instead of `mutate()`.^[The function `summarize()` returns the *mean*  of a variable. Since the variable  *total*  has only one value repeated, this gives us that value with no effort.]


```{r}
# We use the function summarize()  to resume total to a single value
income_rural_value <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income))

income_rural_value
  
```

> Now we can compute the ratio in the final step ! 

### Step 4: Computing the average income for rural households (*numerator/denominator*)

the result should be as simple as a simple division: 

 
$$
Avg\_Income^{rural} = \frac{Total\_Income^{rural}}{Nb\_Households^{rural}} =   \frac{Numerator}{Denominator}
$$


```{r Avg1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat", exercise.cap = "Compute the average"}
# Enter your solution below

avg_income <-
  
```

```{r Avg1-hint-1}
# The ratio is simply using the  / operator

avg_income <-  ? / ?
  

```

```{r Avg1-solution}
# Solution: Divide numerator by denominator

avg_income <- income_rural_value/Nb_rural

avg_income

```


> This required a lot of steps. Couldn't we  *pipe* ( `%>%` ) all of that? 

### Finally: A concise and efficient way of computing

In the following code, we combine all elements using the *pipe* operator `%>%` to chain operations:

> Examine the code below:


```{r final}
avg_income <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural") %>%
  summarize(avg = sum(income) / n() )

avg_income 

```

#### A bit of explanation: 

- `filter()` keep only households from *rura*l areas.
- `sum()` computes the sum over all households (which are all rural now) 
-  `n()` is the number of observations in the current state of the data frame (*so only rural counted here*).^[`n()`is a special function that returns the number of rows in a data frame, typically used inside summarise(), mutate(), or filter() when working with *grouped data*. `count()` groups the data, counts the observations and returns a single value.]
-  The result is affected to the variable named here *avg*
- `summarize()` is used as a *"trick"*  to aggregate across the rows one value since the variable *avg* would be the same for each row)^[The function `summarize()` returns the *mean*  of a variable across the rows. Since here the variable created has only one value repeated, this gives us that value with no effort. There are other way to proceed, but this is one of the simplest one.]

> We will see later that there are  different methods to compute the same results. It is important though to follow the flow of operations and understand the logic of each step. ^[This is another way of computing the same value:
`avg_income2 <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural") %>%
  pull(income) %>%
  mean()` 
  where we use `pull() `to extract the income values (only on rural households) **as a vector**  and to compute the mean of that vector using `mean()`.]


### Check your understanding

```{r quiz2, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Which function is used to subset the dataset to only rural housholds?",
    answer("mutate()", correct = FALSE,  message = " No, mutate is used to create a new variable"),
    answer("summarize()", correct = FALSE, message = "No, summarize provides a summary of a variable"),
    answer("filter()", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes, the filter() function is equivalent to subset(). It follows a logical condition and keep only obervations for wich the outcome is TRUE")
  ),
  
  question("Which function helps to count the number of households?",

    answer("sum()", correct = FALSE, message = "No, the sum() function just sums a variable over all observations."),
    answer("group_by()", correct = FALSE, message = " No,even if we could have counted both location using `group_by()` - but this is a bit advanced.")
  ),
  
  question("Is this code \n
                    avg_income <- household_survey %>%
                        filter(location == 'Rural') %>%
                        summarize(avg = sum(income) / n() \n and this code:  \n
                    avg_income <- household_survey %>%
                        summarize(avg = sum(income) / n()) %>%
                        filter(location == 'Rural') \n  computing the same thing?" ,

    answer("No, because the second code computes the average income over the whole population", correct = TRUE, message = "It is important to first filter() the observations- and the second code does not work"),
    answer("Yes, with the pipe (`%>%`), order is not important", correct = FALSE, message = "The pipe defines a strict order on what is computed! "),
    answer("The first code does not work", correct = FALSE, message = " The first code is a correct way of writing the code"),
    answer("The second code does not work", correct = TRUE, message = " It is not possible to filter  after the summarize, since the variable location does not exist any more")
    ), 
    
   question_checkbox("IMPORTANT: Is there a problem in the way we compute that average?",
    answer("Yes, because we have survey and thus *weights*", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes, We must take the weights into consideration for the computation."),
    answer("No, this is the correct way to go", correct = FALSE, message = "Alas! We have to redo the computation, because we have a survey with weights for each household."),
    answer("I don't know !", correct = FALSE)
  )
)

```


### **Wait: **  Shouldn't we compute a ***weighted*** average? 

> The previous computation did not take into account the fact that,  in a survey, observations are associated with a weight characterizing their representativeness in the target population.

Let's redo the computation with the exact formula: 

 
$$
Avg\_Income^{rural} = \frac{Total\_weighted\_Income^{rural}}{Nb\_weighted\_Households^{rural}} =  \frac{\sum_i Income^{rural}_i \times weight_i }{\sum_i weight_i^{rural}}
$$
We can follow the same scheme, but note that - in step 1 - we already computed the rural sub population in a specific data frame *household_rural*, no need to recompute this! 

###  Step 2bis: Compute the **weighted** income of rural population

Using the code from step 2 above can help:  
                                   
```{r, eval= FALSE}
# This code does not use weights. Remember that the function sum() computes the sum over all observations
income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income))

income_rural

```

What we have to do is to is to *tweak* a bit that code to include weights, as in the correct formula above.  

#### Your turn 

```{r WPopNum, exercise.eval = TRUE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
income_weighted_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income * weight))

```


```{r WPopNum1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "WPopNum", exercise.cap = "Compute the weighted average"}
# Enter your solution below

income_rural <-
  
```

```{r WPopNum1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_rural and the %>% operator
# Use a new line to compute the total of Income

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  

```

```{r WPopNum1-hint-2}
# You can use function summarize() 

income_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize()


```

```{r WPopNum1-solution}
# Solution: We use the function sum() to compute the total

income_weighted_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(weighted_average = sum(income * weight)/ sum(weight))

income_weighted_rural

```

A bit of explanation: 

- `income * weight` multiplies *income* with *weights*  row-by-row (for each observation).
- As previously `sum()` then sums the result across all rows
- since the variable created (weighted_average) is in a data frame, one must take only one value using `summarize()` as previously.

> The computation is done in 2 lines! If we start from the original data set (*household_survey*), it takes 3 lines, and the story is easy to read and tell! 

```{r}
income_weighted_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural") %>%
  summarize(weighted_average = sum(income * weight)/ sum(weight))

round(income_weighted_rural, 2)

```

Let's move on and  compute some SDG indicator now!

## Computing an SDG indicator

We now will earn how to compute the SDG indicator 16.1.3 - *Proportion of persons subjected to physical, psychological or sexual harassment, in the previous12 months*,  with disaggregation by sex.

We will be using the data set for the 2019 National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Security abbreviated **ENVIPE 2019**.^[The microdata for the survey can be accessed on the website of  [INEGI](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/envipe/2019/#microdatos)  under the tab labelled *Microdatos*. Related survey documentation, including the survey questionnaire, report, tabulations and data dictionary can be found under the related tabs.]
The ENVIPE 2019 data set is saved in *.dbf* format (from SPSS software). To load files with that extension, we need the `foreign` package.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(foreign)
envipe <- read.dbf("TPer_Vic2.dbf")
```

As usual, let us explore the *raw* data set that has **`r nrow(envipe)`** observations and **`r ncol(envipe)`** variables. We can familiarize ourselves with the names of the variables using the  function `names()`

```{r}
names(envipe)
```

> It is a good idea to extract only the variables we need for computing the indicator and work with a lighter data set.

The variables we need include (*names are in Spanish*): 

- **SEXO** :  The sex of the survey respondent
- **EDAD**: Age of respondents 
- **AP7_3_11**: Response to question 7 (option 11) "crimes on physical violence that respondents have been victims of, in the previous 12 months 
- **FAC_ELE**: Sampling weight for persons 18+ 

In the next code chunk, we create a new data frame - called *envipe2019* - with only those variables. We use for that the function `select()` to keep only the variables listed.  


```{r}
envipe2019 <- envipe %>%
  select(SEXO,EDAD, AP7_3_11,FAC_ELE)
```

> We use that data set, with still  **`r nrow(envipe2019)`** observations but only  **`r ncol(envipe2019)`** variables, in the rest of the analysis.

### Checking the *type* of each variable

When we read data into R using the import function `read.dbf()`, R tries to keep the structure of the initial data set and interprets numbers and values to assign a *type* to each variable.

> It is very important to identify which variable is of wich *type*, since some operations will only apply for some *type* of variable. For example, Computing the mean of a string variable will not work! 

Types can be **numerical** (*num*),   **integer** (*int*), a **factor** (*factor*)  a **string** (*chr*, for character) or a **Boolean** (*logi* with values TRUE/FALSE) (see the tutorial <a href="https://xtophedataviz.shinyapps.io/BasicR/#section-a-short-tutorial-on-r" target="_blank">Basic R!</a> for a review )  

> The function `str()` provides the structure of the data set and displays the *type* of each variable

```{r}
str(envipe2019)
```


```{r quiz3, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("In the *envipe2019*, are all variables encoded as **factors**?",
    answer("Yes, and this is a problem!", correct = TRUE,  message = " We need to change that since some variables are numerical "),
    answer("Yes, but this is correct", correct = FALSE, message = " - Having variables that are numerical encoded as factors will cause a lot of problem, since some operations will not work correctly on factor variable"),
    answer("No, they are all numbers", correct = FALSE, message = " - All variables, including *EDAD* (Age) and *FAC_ELE* (sampling weight)  are encoded as factors.")
  ), 
  
  question_checkbox("Which operation can be done with the variable *EDAD* (Age) encoded as a `factor`? \n (*Check all correct answers*) ",
    answer("`summary(envipe2019$EDAD)` will provide a summary of the variable *EDAD*" ,
           correct = TRUE,  message = " -  `summary()` applies to factor variables. However it  will consider each unique value of EDAD as a specific factor and count the number of occurence. Not very useful here. "),
     answer("`mean(envipe2019$EDAD)` will provide the mean of *EDAD* " ,
            correct = FALSE,  message = "- It is not possible to take the mean of a factor variable"),
    answer("The code \n
    envipe2019 %>%  \n
        filter(EDAD ==18) \n   extracts observations where EDAD is 18", 
    correct = TRUE, message = "- Yes, the `filter()` function is equivalent to `subset()` and works with factors. It follows the logical condition `EDAD ==18`, keeping only obervations for which the outcome of the test is TRUE"), 
    answer("The code \n
    envipe2019 %>%  \n
        group_by(EDAD) %>% \n 
        count() \n   counts the number of observations for each unique value of EDAD",
    correct = TRUE, message = "- The `group_by()` function is used mostly to compute things for each category of a factor variable. This is something useful when the factor variable has few categories such as *Gender*, or married (Yes/no). Here, since EDAD is not really a factor and has many different values,  we will have a long list."), 
    try_again = " Please try again (check all correct answers) ", allow_retry = TRUE,
    incorrect = "- There are many good answers, try again",
    random_answer_order = TRUE 
  )
)
```


> We have to convert some variables to their right type! 

We know that some variables - namely *EDAD* (Age), and *FAC_ELE* (sampling weights) - are not factor but numbers. We have to convert them to *numeric*  using  `as.numeric()`. **Unfortunately**, we have to be very careful in doing that. In R, factors are stored as integer codes behind the scenes, with labels that appear as characters. When  working  data stored as factors (like *EDAD* or *FAC_ELE*), **you must use** `as.character()`  **before** using `as.numeric()`, to safely recover the numeric values as intended. Skipping this step leads to incorrect data.^[If you convert a factor directly to numeric using `as.numeric()`, R will return the underlying code (by default $1, 2, 3$ etc...), not the actual value you see.]


This operation can be done while creating a new variable with `mutate()`. We take this opportunity to change the name of the variable for easier reading and comprehension and to create a new data frame *envipe2019_clean*. 


```{r}
envipe2019_clean <- envipe2019 %>%
  mutate( Age = as.numeric(as.character(EDAD)), 
          Weight = as.numeric(as.character(FAC_ELE)))
```


Our new data set *envipe2019_clean* has now 2 new variables (Age, and Weight)  and a total of  **`r ncol(envipe2019_clean)`** variables. We can again check their type. 


```{r}
str(envipe2019_clean)
```


> Your turn

#### Compute the summary statistics of the variables *Age* and *Weight* (be careful of the capital letters at the begining of  **A**ge and **W**eight). 


```{r envipe1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = "Compute the summary statistics"}
# Enter your solution below

envipe2019_clean %>%
  
  
```

```{r envipe1-hint-1}
# You first need to select the variables you want to use in the  summary() function

envipe2019_clean %>%
  select() %>%


```

```{r envipe1-hint-2}
# You can use function summary()  function directly

envipe2019_clean %>%
  select(Age, Weight) %>%
  summary()


```

```{r envipe1-solution}
# Solution: We use the function summary() , with some options such as the number of digits

envipe2019_clean %>%
  select(Age, Weight) %>%
  summary(digits = 3)

```

-----

#### $\hookrightarrow$  **Don’t Mix Up** `summary()` and `summarize()`!

In R, `summary()` and `summarize()` are two different functions that serve different purposes:

- `summary()` is a base R function. It gives you a quick statistical overview of your data (*minimum, median, mean, and maximum* values)  for each variable in a data frame. 

- `summarize()` (or `summarise()`) is a *tidyverse* function from the `dplyr` package. It’s used to calculate custom summary statistics (*means, counts, or proportions*), often after grouping your data with group_by(). It works with pipes (`%>%`) and is powerful for building tidy data workflows.

In short: 

- Use `summary()` to ***describe*** (variables in a data set)

- Use `summarize()` to ***compute*** (new objects in a pipe `%>%`)  

----

> Now that all the variables have the right type, we can start compute the SDG indicator 16.1.3.


### Computing the indicator 16.1.3. 

The SDG indicator  16.1.3  is defined as "*the proportion of persons subjected to physical, psychological or sexual harassment, in the previous 12 months*". This is a proportion, which means that it is a ratio, defined by the following equation: 

 
$$
Indicator  = \frac{Nb\_Victims}{Nb\_Population} \times 100
$$

In the ENVIPE questionnaire, the question **AP7_3_11.**  allows to determine if respondents have been the victims of physical, psychological harassment and sexual violence. People victim of physical violence during the reference period can be identified by  **AP7_3_11 == 1**.


But since we have survey, we now know that we should take the sampling weights into consideration. So the exact (and detailed) formula is: 

 
$$
Indicator  =  \frac{Weighted\_Nb\_Victims}{Weighted\_Nb\_Population} \times 100 =  \frac{\sum_{j= Victim} \; weight_j }{\sum_{i=All} \; weight_i} \times 100
$$

### Step by step

> **TBC**


### In a single code, using the pipe `%>%`

> Comments **TBC**

```{r}
SDG_16.1.3 <- envipe2019_clean  %>%
  mutate(WeightedPop = sum(Weight)) %>%
  filter(AP7_3_11 ==1) %>%
  summarize( Indicator = sum(Weight / WeightedPop) *100) 

SDG_16.1.3
```

#### A bit of explanation:

- `mutate(TotalPop = sum(Weight))` calculates the row-sum of the weighted population for the full data set. The result is stored (as a constant value)  in the variable *WeightedPop*. this value is repeated for all raw in the data frame.

- After filtering (*i.e.*, selecting only the victims: `AP7_3_11 == 1`), we compute the percentage in summarize()  by adding over all rows (in `sum() `) the ratio of the weight of each victim, divided by the sum of theweights for the entire population stored in `WeightedPop`.
We follow the slightly simpler formula: 
 
$$
SDG\_16.1.3  =  \frac{\sum_{j= Victim} \; weight_j }{\sum_{i=All} \; weight_i} \times 100 =  \sum_{j= Victim}\frac{ weight_j }{\sum_{i=All} \; weight_i} \times 100  \\ 
Or:  SDG\_16.1.3  =  \sum_{j= Victim} \frac{weight_j }{WeightedPop} \times 100 
$$



### Another way of doing it

```{r}
SDG_16.1.3 <- envipe2019_clean  %>%
  mutate(WeightedPop = sum(Weight)) %>%
  filter(AP7_3_11 ==1) %>%
  summarize( Indicator = 100* sum(Weight) / unique(WeightedPop)) 
  
SDG_16.1.3
  
```

- First step is the same. 

- After filtering (*i.e.*, selecting only the victims: `AP7_3_11 == 1`), we compute the percentage in `summarize()`. The sum of weights,  `sum(Weight)`, is done here only on the sub population of victims ( *i.e.*, our *numerator*) divided by the complete weighted population  generated by `unique(WeightedPop)` (our *denominator*). We have to use   `unique()`  because *WeightedPop* is repeated across all rows, and we only want a single value for the denominator.^[We could have used `max(WeightedPop)` or `min(WeightedPop)` or even `mean(WeightedPop)`, they all provide the same value as `unique(WeightedPop)`.]


### Disagregating the SDG indicator 16.1.3 by Sex

The ***magic*** with the code we used for computing the indicator 16.1.3 is that it is extremely easy and straightforwad to compute that indicator for each value of the factor variable *SEXO* using `group_by()`


We can use the function `group_by()` to compute in the same way (that is we the same code) for each subgroup of the variable SEXO where Male is coded as SEXO = 1 and Female as SEXO = 2.


```{r}

SDG_16.1.3_Sex <- envipe2019_clean  %>%
  group_by(SEXO) %>%
  mutate(WeightedPop = sum(Weight)) %>%
  filter(AP7_3_11 ==1) %>%
  summarize( Indicator = sum(Weight /WeightedPop) *100) 
  

SDG_16.1.3_Sex
  

```


## Matrices and vectors

We now introduce the basics of vectors and matrices in R. These are essential for understanding Input-Output analysis later.

### Matrices

Matrices are 2D arrays of numbers, we use the function `matrix()` to define one. To create a 2x2 matrix, we simply provide 4 numbers composing the matrix in their reading order and specify the dimension of the matrix, here using `nrow = 2`.  


```{r}
M <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
M
```


> Your turn! 

#### Create a 3 by 3 identity matrix 

The result should be the matrix $I_3$:  
$$
I_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

```{r Idmatrix,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = "Compute the 3-D Identity matrix "}
# Enter your solution below

I_3 <- 
  
```


```{r Idmatrix-hint-1}
# You need to use the matrix() function 

I_3 <- matrix()

```


```{r Idmatrix-hint-2}
# Since this is a 3 x3 matrix, we can specify the number of rows

I_3 <- matrix( , nrow =3)


```

```{r Idmatrix-solution}
# Solution: : The sequence of numbers (0 and 1) should be carefully written  

I_3 <- matrix( c(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1) , nrow =3)
I_3

```

As we can imagine, there is also a function (`diag()`) for creating diagonal matrices, and in particular the identity matrix. We can use then simplify our life by using ` I_3 <- diag(3)`

### Matrix operations

***Addition***

One can add matrices of the same dimensions, simply by using ` + `. **Subtraction** works similarly with ` - `.

```{r}
# Adding two matrices A and B 
A <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
B <- matrix(c(2, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 2)

A + B

```


```{r}
# Subtraction with two matrices A and B 
A-B
```

***Multiplication***
Use ` %*% ` for matrix multiplication. 


```{r}
# Matrix multiplication
C = A %*% B  
C

```

With the previous matrices $A$ and $B$, the result is $C = AB$:  $$
C = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2  \\
3 & 4  
\end{bmatrix} \times
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0  \\
0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3  \\
4 & 4 
\end{bmatrix} $$


***Matrix Inversion***

When a matrix is invertible, it can be useful to invert it. This will be useful for input-output analysis.  

```{r}
# Invert the matrix A
InvA <- solve(A)
# Display the inverse of A
InvA

```

> Your turn! 

#### Verify that $A \times InvA  = Id_2$!
The product of a matrix by its inverse should be the identity matrix. Compute that inverse of matrix $A$ and verify! 


```{r Invert,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = "Verify the inverted matrix"}
# Enter your solution below


  
```


```{r Invert-hint-1}
# You need to use the solve() function 

InvA <- solve(A)

```


```{r Invert-solution}
# Solution: The product of A and InvA should be the identity (diemnsion 2)!

A %*% InvA

```

Of course, the matrix A has to be invertible. If not,   `solve(A)` will return an error. 

## An Input-Output Analysis

In this exercise we will do an *Input-Output* analysis  using a 3x3 industry-by-industry table (named $Ind_1$, $Ind_2$, $Ind_3$). Steps include:

- Computing the technical coefficients
- Computing the Leontief inverse, 
- Computing the value-added and import multipliers, and
- Computing the emissions intensity.

The core of the analysis is the transaction matrix $Z$ , which shows how much each industry buys from and sells to the others. In this input-output matrix, the rows signify the output and the columns represent the inputs 


```{r}
# Transaction matrix: Inputs (columns) to Outputs (rows)
Z <- matrix(c(20,75,93,
              31,83,99,
              26,59,56),  nrow = 3)
# We can add names to rows and columns here
colnames(Z) <- c("I-IND1", "I-IND2", "I-IND3")
rownames(Z) <- c("0-IND1", "0-IND2", "0-IND3")
Z
```


The matrix Z, is the input-output matrix and will play an important role.  $$
Z = \begin{bmatrix}
20 & 75 & 93 \\ 
31 & 83 & 99 \\  
26 & 59 & 56
\end{bmatrix}$$



We can also define the vector of the values of **imported inputs** $M$, as well as the **Value added** $VA$, and the **final demand** for each good $Y$. 


```{r}
# Imported inputs 
M <- c(40, 110, 50)

# Value added 
VA <- c(42, 77, 189)

# Final demand
Y <- c(110, 205, 227)
```

### Step 1: Compute Total Output (X)

The total output $X$ of each industry is the sum of intermediate consumption, imports, value-added, and final demand. To compute the sum of the intermediate consumption, we need to sum all elements for each columns of the matrix $Z$. For that, we can use the function `colSums()` that computes the sum of the values in each column of a matrix or data frame in R. The result is a line vector. 

. 
```{r}
# creating a vector with the sum of the values in each column
colSums(Z)
```

The total output ($TO$) for each industry, is then the sum of the vectors representing the intermediate consumption (from Z), imports (M) , value-added (VA), and final demand (Y).

```{r}
# The total output is a sum of  vectors
TO<- colSums(Z) + M + VA + Y
TO
```
### Step 2: Technical Coefficient Matrix


The **technical coefficient matrix** \( A \) shows the input required from each industry per unit of output of each industry. 

\[ A_{ij} = \frac{Z_{ij}}{X_j} \]

This requires a computation by dividing each column of $Z$ by the total output ($TO$). 


```{r}
# some explanations needed here !!!
MatA <- t(t(Z) / TO)
MatA
```
