## Work with survey data and Compute SDG indicators 

Welcome to the course.^[This document uses materials developed by *Garrick Aden-Buie, Barret Schloerke, JJ Allaire & Alexander Rossell Hayes* , the creators of the [learner](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package. *This version is 2.4 (October 2023)*.]  



### Learning Objectives **TBD**
At the end of this module you should be able to:   

* Run a few lines of R code
* Compute averages from Survey data
* Create descriptive statistics and graphics
* Compute with matrices


>*We highly recommend that you follow the order of the items proposed in this tutorial*!

```{r}
#  The code below is for the moment a copy of LearnR.Rmd
#  The construction will be based on the same structure
```


### Have you successfully completed the R-Tutorial?

```{r quiz0, echo = FALSE}
question("Have you completed the basic R- Tutorial?  (*Check all that is TRUE*):",
  answer("Yes", correct = TRUE, message = "Perfect"),
  answer("No, I'm just starting here",  message = "Please start at the beginning with the Basic R course (https://xtophedataviz.shinyapps.io/BasicR/)" )
  )
  
```

## Let's start simple

### Compute the average income by category from survey data
We have a data set from a survey that reports information on `r nrow(household_survey)` households, including their *location* (urban or rural), their *income* and other information.

Let's have a look at the 5 first rows of this data set called *household_survey*:

```{r}
head(household_survey)
```

> We want to compute  the average income for *rural*` population.  How would you do? 

The formula is the following: 
 
$$
Avg\_Income_{rural} = \frac{Total\_Income_{rural}}{Nb\_Households_{rural}}
$$

There are 4 basic steps: 

- Select only rural population 
- Compute the total income of rural population $\rightarrow$ Numerator
- Count the number of rural households $\rightarrow$ Denominator
- Compute the ratio 

We will compute this step-by step! 

### Step 1: Selecting only rural households

This can be done using the `filter` function in the *tidyverse* librar. This function allows to filter only observations (rows) that satisfy a condition.

> In our case, we only want housholds that have a location that is rural

Give it a try and create a new data frame with only rural households

```{r PopDat, exercise.eval = TRUE}
household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural")

```

```{r PopDat1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
# Enter your solution below

household_rural <-
  

```

```{r PopDat1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_survey and the %>% operator
# Use a new line with a condition on location

household_rural <-  household_survey %>%
  
```

```{r PopDat1-hint-2}
# You can use function filter () --> Write the condition in the filter() function

household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter()
  
```

```{r PopDat1-solution}
# Solution: Pay attention to the double == when conditioning

household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural")

```

**Congratulations** The data frame *household_rural* has now only rural households. 

Check the new data frame here and observe the first rows. They should now be all rural (run code).  

```{r Popex-Valid, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
head(household_rural)
```


### Step 2: Compute the total income of rural population

```{r PopNum, exercise.eval = TRUE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
total_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income))

```



```{r PopNum1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopNum"}
# Enter your solution below

total_rural <-
  

```


```{r PopNum1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_rural and the %>% operator
# Use a new line to compute the total of Income

total_rural <- household_rural %>%
  

```

```{r PopNum1-hint-2}
# You can use function summarize() -->  Write the code in the function

total_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize()


```

```{r PopNum1-solution}
# Solution: We use the function sum()  to compute the total

total_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income))

total_rural

```


### Step 3: Counting rural households



```{r PopDen1,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "PopDat"}
# Enter your solution below

Nb_rural <-
  

```


```{r PopDen1-hint-1}
# You should use the data from household_rural and the %>% operator
# Use a new line to compute the total of Income

Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  

```

```{r PopDen1-hint-2}
# You can use the function count() -->  Write the code in a new line

Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  count()


```


```{r PopDen1-solution}
# Solution: We simply use the count() function to compute the number of rows!
Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  count()

Nb_rural
```



### Finally: Computing the average income for rural households 

```{r final}
avg_income <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural") %>%
  summarize(avg_income = sum(income) / Nb_rural)

pull(avg_income)
```



### Quiz

```{r quiz2, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Which function is used to filter the dataset?",
    answer("mutate()", correct = FALSE),
    answer("summarize()", correct = FALSE),
    answer("filter()", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  
  question("Which function helps to count the number of households?",
    answer("count()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("sum()", correct = FALSE),
    answer("group_by()", correct = FALSE)
  ),
  
  question_checkbox("Which functions were used in computing the average income?",
    answer("filter()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("summarize()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("mutate()", correct = FALSE),
    answer("group_by()", correct = FALSE)
  )
)

```
