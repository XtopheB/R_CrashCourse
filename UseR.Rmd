```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# In this chuck, all elements are loaded for the rest of the document!
library(learnr)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(stringr)

# We need to have here all objects used in multiple chunks!!
# Loading data--  

## For SDG computation 
household_survey <- read.csv2("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XtopheB/JICA23/main/Exercises/Household_Survey.csv") %>% select(-"X") %>%
  select(c("household_id", "income", "location"), everything()) %>%
  rename(Id = household_id)%>%
  mutate(income = income /1000)

## Some objects that will be computed:
household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural")

Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  count()


```

## Welcome 

Welcome to the course.^[This document uses materials developed by *Garrick Aden-Buie, Barret Schloerke, JJ Allaire & Alexander Rossell Hayes* , the creators of the [learner](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package. *This version is 2.4 (October 2023)*.]  


### Learning Objectives TBD
At the end of this tutorial you should be able to:   

* Run a few lines of R code
* Compute a few simple SDG indicators
* Write a function, define the scope and utility of its parameters 

>*We highly recommend that you follow the order of the items proposed in this tutorial*!

```{r}
#  The code below is for the moment a copy of LearnR.Rmd
#  The construction will be based on the same structure
```

### Have you successfully completed the R-Tutorial?

```{r quiz0, echo = FALSE}
question("Have you completed the R- Tutorial?  (*Check all that is TRUE*):",
         
  answer("Yes, and R is installed on my computer", correct = TRUE, message = "Perfect"),
  
  answer("Yes, but R is not installed on my computer", 
        message = "*No worries*, you can run R directly here, but **please install R** later at [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org)"),
  
  answer("No, I'm just starting here", message = "Please start at the beginning with the R Tutorial"), 
  allow_retry = TRUE
  )
  
```

## A first simple computation

### Compute the average income by category from survey data
We have a data set from a survey that reports information on `r nrow(household_survey)` households, including their location (urban or rural), their income and other information.

Let's have a look at the 5 first rows of this data set called *household_survey*:

```{r}
head(household_survey)
```

> We want to compute  the average income for *rural*` population.  How would you do? 

There are 3 basic steps: 

- Select only rural population 
- Compute the total income of rural population 
- Count the number of rural households

Then the result will simply be 
$$
Avg\_Income_{rural} = \frac{Total\_Income_{rural}}{Nb\_Households_{rural}}
$$

### Step-by-step

Filter only rural households

**Step 1**: Selecting only rurla households
```{r}
household_rural <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural")

```

**Step 2**: Calculating the total income for rural households
```{r}
total_rural <- household_rural %>%
  summarize(total = sum(income))

total_rural
```

**Step 3**: Counting rural households
```{r count}
Nb_rural <- household_rural %>%
  count()

Nb_rural
```

**Finally**: Computing the average income for rural households 

```{r final}
avg_income <- household_survey %>%
  filter(location == "Rural") %>%
  summarize(avg_income = sum(income) / Nb_rural)

pull(avg_income)
```



# Quiz

```{r quiz2, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Which function is used to filter the dataset?",
    answer("mutate()", correct = FALSE),
    answer("summarize()", correct = FALSE),
    answer("filter()", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  
  question("Which function helps to count the number of households?",
    answer("count()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("sum()", correct = FALSE),
    answer("group_by()", correct = FALSE)
  ),
  
  question_checkbox("Which functions were used in computing the average income?",
    answer("filter()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("summarize()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("mutate()", correct = FALSE),
    answer("group_by()", correct = FALSE)
  )
)

```



> There are a lot of other things to learn, please read the [Tidyverse reference manual](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) and  enjoy other tutorials like [this one](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/04/tidyverse-in-r-complete-tutorial/)  or [that one](https://www.pkimes.com/PR2019replicathon/tutorials/0b_R_tidyverse.html) and search on the web by yourself, there are hundreds of examples.

Enjoy!
